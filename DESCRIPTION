Title: Spatiotemporal Data Interpolation and Visualisation based on 3D Tessellation
Description: Employs Voro++ for the calculation of three dimensional Voronoi diagrams from
    input point clouds. This is a special form of tessellation where each polygon is defined 
    as the area closest to one particular seed point. Voronoi diagrams have useful applications
    in - among others - astronomy, material science or geography and bleiglas provides functions 
    to make 3D tessellation more readily available as a mean for data visualisation and interpolation.
    It can be used for any 3D point cloud, but the output is optimized for spatiotemporal applications 
    in archaeology.
